  "response": "**Recommended Analysis: Urban Heat Island Mapping**\nConfidence Score: 80.0%\nMatch Type: direct\n\n*This API can help identify heat patterns around CapitaLand's properties, which is relevant for managing energy consumption, tenant comfort, and climate resilience.*\n\n---\n\n**Analysis Results:**\n\nThe analysis of CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust in Singapore reveals a mean temperature of 37.9°C with some areas reaching up to 38.27°C. About 18.8% of the analyzed area is classified as a heat island. The vegetation health is low, which could be contributing to the higher temperatures.\n\nThe Urban Heat Island Mapping API was used to analyze the thermal characteristics of CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust in Singapore. The mean temperature across the analyzed area is 37.9°C, with a standard deviation of 0.23°C, indicating relatively consistent temperatures across the site. However, the maximum temperature reaches 38.27°C, exceeding the heat threshold of 38.13°C, meaning that some parts of the property are significantly hotter than average. A heat island fraction of 18.8% suggests that almost one-fifth of the area is experiencing elevated temperatures. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is quite low at 0.095, classifying the vegetation health as 'low'. This is important because healthy vegetation helps to cool the environment through evapotranspiration. The data was sourced from Landsat 8/9 satellites, with a spatial resolution of 30 meters, meaning each pixel in the analysis represents a 30x30 meter area on the ground. The image used for analysis was captured on 2025-09-24, with a cloud cover of 16.4%. Given the location in Singapore, high humidity levels could exacerbate the effects of the urban heat island, making these temperature differences more impactful on building energy consumption and human comfort.",
